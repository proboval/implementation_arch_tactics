# Preface {.unnumbered}

This study guide accompanies the thesis *Automated Implementation of Architectural Tactics for Software Quality Improvement* (Innopolis University, 2026). It is designed as a self-contained educational resource that walks the reader through the foundational concepts, research landscape, and open problems at the intersection of software architecture, maintainability, and large language models.

**Who this guide is for.** Graduate students (MS level) studying software architecture and software quality engineering. It assumes you have completed an undergraduate course in software engineering and are comfortable reading code in at least one mainstream programming language (Python, Java, or similar). No prior expertise in architectural tactics, static analysis, or LLMs is required --- the guide builds these concepts from the ground up.

**Prerequisites.** A working understanding of basic software engineering concepts: modules, interfaces, coupling, cohesion, version control, and unit testing. Familiarity with at least one object-oriented or multi-paradigm programming language. Exposure to design patterns (e.g., Observer, Facade, Strategy) is helpful but not mandatory.

**How to use this guide.** The chapters are ordered so that each one builds on the preceding material. If you are new to the topic, read sequentially from Chapter 1 (Motivation) through to the end. If you already have a background in software architecture, you may jump directly to Chapter 4 (Architectural Tactics) or Chapter 7 (LLMs for Code Refactoring). Each chapter opens with learning objectives and closes with review questions to test your understanding.

**A note on citations.** All references in this guide use the format `[@key]` and resolve to the bibliography at the end of the document. For example, `[@bass2021software]` refers to Bass, Clements, and Kazman's *Software Architecture in Practice* (4th ed., 2021). When multiple sources support a single claim, they appear together: `[@perry1992foundations; @garlan1993introduction]`. The full bibliography is provided in `references.bib` and can be processed with pandoc-citeproc.
