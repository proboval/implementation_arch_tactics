    "Clear separation of concerns with distinct modules: models, services, utils, and config",
    "Presence of a single entry point (app.py) coordinating various modules",
    "Directory structure shows logical grouping of functionality (e.g., services for business logic, utils for shared tools, models for data structures)",
    "No evidence of distributed communication mechanisms (e.g., message queues, HTTP APIs between components) suggesting a monolithic deployment",
    "Use of Flask framework suggests web application structure but contained within a single deployable unit",
