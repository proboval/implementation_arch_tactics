    "Internal services (e.g., order_service, price_service) depend on each other but are organized by business capability",
    "Use of dependency inversion where higher-level modules depend on abstractions (e.g., BaseTradingStrategy)",

    "Tight coupling between internal modules could emerge over time without strict enforcement of boundaries",
    "Lack of explicit ports and adapters pattern may lead to infrastructure concerns leaking into business logic",
    "As the system grows, module interdependencies may become harder to manage without clear layering"
