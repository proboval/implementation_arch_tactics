  "evidence": [
    "Repository contains multiple standalone Python scripts (doubles.py, doubles_all.py, etc.) with no clear package structure",
    "Each script appears to be self-contained with its own imports and functions",
    "Presence of build scripts and extensions (pyext-myclib, pyext-myrustlib) suggests script-level integration rather than architectural organization",
    "Maximum directory depth is only 2, indicating flat structure",
    "No evidence of layered organization, MVC patterns, or service decomposition",
    "Average fan-out of 5.0 suggests loose coupling between scripts and modules",
    "Low maintainability index (67.86 average) consistent with script-based development"

    "Low code maintainability may become problematic as scripts grow",
    "Lack of architectural structure may hinder long-term project scalability",
    "Tight coupling between scripts and external libraries (numpy, rust extensions)"
