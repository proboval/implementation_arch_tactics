  "confidence": 0.95,
  "evidence": [
    "Clear separation of concerns with distinct layers: context, exception, http, json, model, security, and util packages",
    "Model layer is further divided into core and generated sub-layers indicating layered architecture",
    "HTTP client functionality is isolated in http package with clear API client implementations",
    "JSON serialization/deserialization is handled by dedicated json package with adapter pattern implementation",
    "Context management is separated into its own package with clear responsibility for API context, user context, and session management",
    "Exception handling is centralized in exception package with specific exception types",
    "Security concerns are isolated in security package with encryption and signing functionality",
    "Models follow a base class pattern (BunqModel) suggesting inheritance-based layering",
    "Package structure shows clear horizontal separation with no circular dependencies evident"

  "risks": [
    "High package count (18 packages) may indicate over-engineering for simpler use cases",
    "Deep directory nesting (max depth 5) could complicate navigation and maintenance",
    "Some packages like 'model/generated' suggest code generation which may increase complexity"
