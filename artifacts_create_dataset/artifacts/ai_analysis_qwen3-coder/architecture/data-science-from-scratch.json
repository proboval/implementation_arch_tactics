    "Repository contains multiple cohesive modules (e.g., clustering, linear_algebra, machine_learning) with clear boundaries",
    "Each module appears self-contained with related functionality grouped together",
    "Low package count (3) with moderate fan-out (4.5) suggests modular organization without microservices",
    "No clear separation of ports/adapters indicating non-hexagonal architecture",

    "Tight coupling between modules may develop over time without clear interface contracts",
    "Lack of explicit architectural enforcement may lead to structural decay",
    "Testing boundaries between modules may become complex"
