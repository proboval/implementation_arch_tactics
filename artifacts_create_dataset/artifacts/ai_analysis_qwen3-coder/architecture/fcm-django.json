  "evidence": [
    "Clear module separation with 'fcm_django' as the main module containing submodules like 'api', 'migrations'",
    "Presence of Django-specific constructs like models, views (ViewSet), migrations indicating a structured monolithic application",
    "API modules are separated by framework (rest_framework, tastypie) suggesting internal modularization",
    "Use of swappable models and abstract base classes indicating extensibility within a single codebase",
    "Tests are structured in a separate top-level directory with clear organization mirroring the source structure",
    "Average fan-out of ~2.075 suggests moderate inter-module dependencies, typical of modular monoliths",
    "Directory depth of 4 indicates structured organization without extreme nesting"
