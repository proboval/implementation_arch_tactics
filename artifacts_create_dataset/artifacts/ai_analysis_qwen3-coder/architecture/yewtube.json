  "evidence": [
    "Clear module separation with 'commands', 'players', 'listview' sub-packages indicating functional boundaries",
    "High cohesion within modules - commands package contains command-specific functionality, players contains player implementations",
    "Low coupling between modules - modules import from each other but maintain distinct responsibilities",
    "Shared core modules like 'g.py', 'c.py', 'util.py' act as common infrastructure",
    "Package structure shows logical grouping: commands, players, listview, test",
    "Average fan-out of 5.0 indicates moderate inter-module dependencies",
    "Maximum directory depth of 3 suggests flat, manageable module hierarchy",
    "Presence of __init__.py files indicating proper Python package structure",
    "Test modules are separated but within the same monolithic structure"

  "risks": [
    "Some modules like 'util.py' and 'g.py' appear to be shared across many components, could become coupling bottlenecks",
    "Maintainability index average of 61.2 suggests moderate complexity that could impact long-term modularity",
    "Without explicit layering, there's risk of dependency cycles between modules"
