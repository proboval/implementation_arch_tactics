    "Repository structure shows multiple numbered directories with single Python files, indicating standalone scripts or examples",
    "No packages or modules are defined, suggesting a flat structure",
    "Each directory appears to contain isolated examples or exercises rather than components of a larger system",
    "Files are named similarly across directories (e.g., dropdown.py, app.py), suggesting reusable snippets or templates rather than organized modules",
    "Average fan-out is low (2.33), consistent with simple, independent scripts",
    "Maximum directory depth is only 2, which aligns with a simple example-based layout"
