    "Code is organized into a single package 'pyspace' with multiple modules (camera, coloring, fold, geo, object, shader, util)",
    "Clear separation of concerns with distinct modules handling specific responsibilities (e.g., graphics, geometry, shaders)",
    "No evidence of layered architecture patterns like presentation, business, or data layers",
    "No indication of ports and adapters or external interface abstractions for hexagonal style",
    "Absence of multiple services or distributed components rules out microservices_like",
    "Low directory depth (max 2) and no packages indicate a flat modular structure",
    "High fan-out (3.0) suggests modules depend on multiple other modules within the same codebase",
    "All functionality appears to be part of one cohesive application without external service calls"

    "Tight coupling between modules could emerge as the system grows",
    "Lack of explicit architectural boundaries may lead to degraded modularity over time",
    "Single package structure may become unwieldy as more features are added"
