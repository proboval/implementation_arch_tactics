  "evidence": [
    "Clear module separation with distinct packages (connections, fuzzers, mutants, loggers, monitors, etc.)",
    "Each module has well-defined interfaces and abstract base classes (IFuzzer, IMonitor, ITargetConnection)",
    "High cohesion within packages - mutants package contains all mutation-related classes",
    "Low coupling between modules through interface abstractions",
    "Consistent use of __init__.py files indicating intentional module organization",
    "Package depth of 4 levels suggests thoughtful architectural decomposition",
    "Average fan-out of 2.85 indicates moderate inter-module dependencies",
    "Extensive use of inheritance and abstract base classes for extension points"

  "risks": [
    "Some modules like 'fuzzers' contain protocol-specific implementations that could benefit from further decoupling",
    "High number of packages (21) might indicate some modules could be consolidated",
    "Maintainability index shows variation (25.98 min to 79.02 avg) suggesting some modules may be overly complex"
