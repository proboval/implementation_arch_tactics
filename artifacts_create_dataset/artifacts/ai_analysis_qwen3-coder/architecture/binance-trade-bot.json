  "evidence": [
    "Clear separation of concerns with distinct modules: models, strategies, and core components",
    "High cohesion within modules (e.g., all database-related code in database.py and models/ directory)",
    "Low coupling between modules through well-defined interfaces and dependency injection",
    "Single deployment unit with internal modularity rather than distributed services",
    "Presence of a main entry point (__main__.py) indicating monolithic execution",

    "Directory depth of 3 may indicate some complexity in module organization",
    "Maintainability index average of 68.8 suggests moderate code complexity",
    "Some modules like binance_api_manager.py have high internal complexity"
