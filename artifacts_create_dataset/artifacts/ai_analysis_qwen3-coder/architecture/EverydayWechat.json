    "Clear separation of concerns with distinct modules like 'control', 'utils', and 'tests'",
    "Each module (e.g., airquality, bot, weather) encapsulates related functionality",
    "Low average fan-out (1.15) suggests limited inter-module dependencies",
    "Presence of a single main entry point (main.py) coordinating various modules",

    "As the project grows, maintaining module boundaries without enforced architectural rules may become challenging",
    "Some modules like 'control' have many submodules which could indicate a need for further decomposition or domain-driven design"
