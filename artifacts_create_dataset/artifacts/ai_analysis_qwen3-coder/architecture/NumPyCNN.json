  "evidence": [
    "Code is organized into distinct classes (e.g., Conv2D, Dense, Model) with clear responsibilities, suggesting modular structure",
    "Presence of a single cohesive library (NumPyCNN) implementing a CNN framework indicates a monolithic design",
    "No evidence of distributed services or API-based communication that would indicate microservices_like",
    "Lack of explicit ports/adapters or external interface abstractions reduces likelihood of hexagonal architecture",
    "Directory structure is shallow (max depth 2) and files are grouped logically by functionality"

  "risks": [
    "Low maintainability index (mi_avg=60.76) may indicate tight coupling within modules",
    "Absence of packages or namespaces could lead to naming conflicts and reduced scalability"
