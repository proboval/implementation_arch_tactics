    "Clear separation of concerns with distinct modules like 'mochi_preview/dit', 'mochi_preview/vae' and root-level utility files such as 'fp8_optimization.py', 'infer.py'",
    "Presence of multiple self-contained components (e.g., model loading, encoding/decoding, sampling) in 'nodes.py' that are cohesive yet decoupled",
    "Hierarchical directory structure with up to 4 levels deep organization indicating logical grouping rather than flat or service-oriented layout",
