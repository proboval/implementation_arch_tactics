    "Clear separation of concerns with distinct layers: model, operations, utils, and errors",
    "Models inherit from base classes and use mixins, indicating a structured domain layer",
    "Operations layer (get, list, data_list) abstracts data access patterns",
    "Utils layer provides common functionality (api_key_util, request_type_util)",
    "Error handling is centralized in a dedicated errors module",
