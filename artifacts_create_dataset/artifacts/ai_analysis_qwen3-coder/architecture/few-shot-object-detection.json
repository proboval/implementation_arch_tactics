    "Clear module separation with 'fsdet' as the main package containing submodules like 'checkpoint', 'config', 'data', 'engine', 'evaluation', 'modeling', 'model_zoo', and 'utils'",
    "Each submodule has a distinct responsibility (e.g., 'modeling' for neural network architectures, 'evaluation' for evaluation metrics, 'data' for dataset handling)",
    "Presence of '__init__.py' files indicating Python packages and intentional module structuring",
    "Use of registry patterns (e.g., META_ARCH_REGISTRY, ROI_HEADS_REGISTRY) suggesting a plugin-like modular design within a single deployable unit",
    "Shared configuration and utility modules used across different parts of the system",
    "No evidence of network-based service communication or script-based orchestration"

    "Tight coupling between modules through shared state or direct imports may reduce modularity in practice",
    "Absence of explicit boundaries or interfaces between modules could lead to architectural drift over time"
