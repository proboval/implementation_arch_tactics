  "evidence": [
    "Clear module separation in the 'coursera' package with distinct functional areas (api, commandline, cookies, downloaders, extractors, workflow, etc.)",
    "Low package count (2 total) with high internal modularity",
    "Presence of comprehensive test suite following module structure",
    "Each module has single responsibility (e.g., api.py handles API interactions, downloaders.py handles file downloads)",
    "Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces and dependency injection",
    "No evidence of distributed service boundaries or HTTP-based inter-service communication",
    "Shared data models and utilities across modules indicating monolithic structure",
    "Average fan-out of 5.9 suggests moderate inter-module dependencies typical of modular monoliths"

  "risks": [
    "Module coupling could increase over time without proper dependency management",
    "Testing boundaries between modules may become complex",
    "Potential for circular dependencies between closely related modules like api and extractors"
