    "Files are organized in a flat structure with clear module-like responsibilities (e.g., login, configloader, printer, statistics)",
    "High avg_fan_out (6.28) suggests tight coupling between modules but still within a single deployable unit",
    "No packages or deep directory structures, indicating lack of strict layering or microservices separation",
    "Presence of cross-module imports without clear directionality implies a monolithic structure with internal modularity",
    "Each file appears to encapsulate specific functionality (e.g., TCP_monitor, OnlineHeart, Tasks) resembling modules rather than services or layers"

    "Tight coupling between modules may lead to maintenance challenges as the system grows",
    "Absence of clear architectural boundaries can result in difficulty isolating changes or testing components independently",
    "Flat structure with high fan-out may indicate lack of long-term architectural scalability"
