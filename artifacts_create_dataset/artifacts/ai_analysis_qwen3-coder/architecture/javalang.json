  "evidence": [
    "Clear module structure with 'javalang' as the main package and 'test' as a sub-package, indicating logical separation of concerns",
    "Low average fan-out (1.4) suggests limited inter-module dependencies, consistent with modular design",
    "Directory depth of 3 is minimal, supporting a single cohesive unit rather than distributed services",
    "Presence of distinct functional modules: tokenizer, parser, ast, javadoc, and tree, each encapsulating specific responsibilities",
    "Internal imports are managed within the same package structure (e.g., relative imports like 'from . import util')",
    "No evidence of network-based communication or service boundaries that would indicate microservices or hexagonal architecture",
    "Absence of UI-related components or controllers that would suggest MVC"

    "If the project scales significantly, maintaining clear boundaries without enforced architectural constraints may become difficult",
    "Testing and core logic are co-located; separation might be needed for larger teams or deployment models"
