  "evidence": [
    "Clear separation of concerns with distinct modules: cli, core, directives, formatters, parser, plugins, utils",
    "Each module has its own __init__.py and contains related functionality",
    "Plugins architecture with separate plugin classes in plugins/ directory",
    "Formatters module with multiple output format implementations",
    "Core module containing business logic separated from IO operations",
    "Parser module dedicated to parsing nginx configurations",

  "risks": [
    "Some modules like 'core' might become too large and require further decomposition",
    "Plugin architecture could evolve into microservices if scaled significantly",
    "Tight coupling between parser and directive modules through nginx-specific logic"
