  "evidence": [
    "Code is organized into a single top-level package 'trevorproxy' with a clear internal module structure under 'lib'",
    "Modules like 'ssh.py', 'socks.py', 'subnet.py' represent distinct functional areas with clear responsibilities",
    "Presence of a CLI entry point ('cli.py') that orchestrates the core functionality",
    "Low package count (0) but meaningful directory depth (max 3) indicating internal organization without external package dependencies",
    "Average fan-out of 5.375 suggests moderate inter-module coupling, consistent with modular monolith design",
    "Classes such as SSHProxy, SocksProxy, and SubnetProxy indicate cohesive modules with well-defined boundaries"

    "High fan-out may indicate some modules are too coupled, risking future maintainability",
