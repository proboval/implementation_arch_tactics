    "Repository contains multiple standalone scripts (e.g., .js and .py files) in function directories",
    "Each directory appears to implement a single functionality or integration (e.g., bilibili, xiaomi_sports)",
    "Presence of duplicated utility files (e.g., multiple sendNotify.py copies) suggests copy-paste reuse typical of scripts",
    "No evidence of layered organization or modular structure beyond simple directory grouping",
    "Low maintainability index (mi_avg: 42.45) consistent with script-based projects",
    "Shallow directory depth (max 3) and lack of packages indicate minimal architectural structuring"

  "risks": [
    "Code duplication (e.g., sendNotify.py copied across modules)",
    "Tight coupling between scripts and specific platforms (e.g., Bilibili, Xiaomi)",
    "Poor scalability due to lack of architectural boundaries",
    "Maintenance overhead from duplicated logic and inconsistent implementations"
