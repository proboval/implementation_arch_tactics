  "evidence": [
    "Clear module separation with 'http_prompt' as the main package containing submodules like 'context', 'completion', 'execution'",
    "Well-defined internal boundaries with distinct responsibilities per module (e.g., 'lexer.py', 'completer.py', 'execution.py')",
    "Presence of a single entry point ('cli.py') that orchestrates the application flow",
    "Internal APIs are used for communication between components rather than external services",
    "Tests are organized mirroring the source structure, indicating modular design",
    "Average fan-out of 3.39 suggests moderate inter-module dependencies, typical of modular monoliths",
    "Directory depth of 3 indicates a structured but not overly complex internal hierarchy"
