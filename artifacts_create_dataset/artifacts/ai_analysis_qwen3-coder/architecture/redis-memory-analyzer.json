  "evidence": [
    "Clear module separation with 'rma' as the main package containing sub-packages like 'cli', 'helpers', 'reporters', 'rule'",
    "Each module has a well-defined responsibility (e.g., CLI handling, reporting, Redis type analysis)",
    "Presence of __init__.py files indicating intentional Python package structure",
    "Low average fan-out (2.38) suggesting loose coupling between modules",
    "Directory depth of 3 indicates organized hierarchical structure without excessive nesting",
    "Presence of tests in a separate top-level directory following common Python project conventions",
    "Use of specific classes per Redis data type in the 'rule' package shows domain-driven design within a single codebase"

  "risks": [
    "Some modules like 'rma.redis' have many helper functions which could indicate tight coupling if not carefully managed",
    "The 'application.py' file contains several responsibilities that might benefit from further decomposition",
    "No explicit interface abstractions suggest potential challenges in testing and extensibility"
