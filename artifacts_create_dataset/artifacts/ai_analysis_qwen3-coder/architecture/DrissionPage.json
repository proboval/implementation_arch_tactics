    "Single package structure with clear module separation in subdirectories (_base, _configs, _elements, _functions, _pages, _units)",
    "High average fan-out (4.84) indicating extensive cross-module dependencies",
    "Maximum directory depth of 3 suggests flat modular organization",
    "Clear separation of concerns with dedicated modules for different functionalities (browser automation, element handling, page management)",
    "Evidence of internal APIs with abstract base classes (BasePage, BaseElement, BaseParser)",
