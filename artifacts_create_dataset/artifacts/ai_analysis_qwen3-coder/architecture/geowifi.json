  "evidence": [
    "Single main file (geowifi.py) with multiple function definitions suggests a procedural/script-based approach",
    "No clear package structure or modular organization beyond helper files",
    "Low number of files analyzed (2), indicating minimal modularization",
    "Presence of protobuf-generated code in helpers suggests tooling support rather than architectural design",

  "risks": [
    "Low maintainability index (mi_avg: 68.7) may indicate difficulty in scaling the script-based approach",
    "High average fan-out (6.0) suggests potential tight coupling between functions",
    "Lack of clear architectural boundaries may lead to maintenance challenges as the project grows"
