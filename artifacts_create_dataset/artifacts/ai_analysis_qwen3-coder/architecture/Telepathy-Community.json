    "Separation of concerns with distinct files for configuration (config.ini), constants (const.py), utilities (utils.py), and main logic (telepathy.py)",
    "Absence of multiple services or packages indicating microservices or distributed architecture",

    "Low maintainability index (mi_avg: 59.47) may indicate tight coupling or code quality issues within modules",
    "Maximum directory depth of 4 may hint at some nested complexity, which if not managed, could degrade modularity over time"
