  "evidence": [
    "Clear module separation with 'budou' package containing multiple related modules (parser, segmenter, chunk, cache)",
    "Use of abstract base classes (ABC) for extensibility (Segmenter, Parser, BudouCache)",
    "Multiple implementation variants for same interfaces (MecabSegmenter, NLAPISegmenter, TinysegmenterSegmenter)",
    "Factory pattern usage (get_parser, load_cache)",
    "Consistent internal package structure with 2 packages and max directory depth of 2",
