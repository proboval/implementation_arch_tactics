  },
  "justification": "The current script-based architecture exhibits a flat structure with minimal organization, limiting scalability and increasing maintenance difficulty. Decomposability addresses these issues by promoting modular design and separation of concerns, which aligns with the need to restructure the codebase into more manageable and isolated components. This will improve testability, analyzability, and overall maintainability.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the two monolithic scripts into smaller, cohesive modules or packages based on functionality (e.g., version checking, authentication bypass logic, utilities). Introduce clear interfaces between modules and reduce interdependencies to support independent development and testing.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may introduce bugs if not done carefully; requires thorough testing to ensure behavior remains consistent. Team members may also need time to adapt to the new structure."
