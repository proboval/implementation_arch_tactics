  "justification": "The project exhibits a modular monolith architecture with clear separation of concerns, but some modules like 'control' have many submodules which could indicate a need for further decomposition. Reducing coupling between components will decrease the modification range and prevent ripple effects across subsystems, thus improving maintainability. This is particularly relevant given the low average fan-out (1.15), suggesting that inter-module dependencies are already limited, but can be further minimized.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor existing modules to minimize dependencies between them by introducing interfaces or abstract classes where necessary. Ensure each module interacts with others through well-defined APIs rather than direct references. This may involve creating new abstraction layers or reorganizing existing code to enforce stricter boundaries between modules.",
  "risks": "Introducing abstractions to reduce coupling may add complexity to the system if not done carefully. Over-engineering abstractions can lead to unnecessary overhead and make the system harder to understand. It's important to balance the level of abstraction with the actual needs of the system."
