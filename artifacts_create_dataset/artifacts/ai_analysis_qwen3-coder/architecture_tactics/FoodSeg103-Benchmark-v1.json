  "justification": "The architecture analysis shows a modular monolith with good separation of concerns but highlights potential for tight coupling through shared utility modules. The low average fan-out (1.106) indicates loose coupling is already partially achieved, but reducing coupling further would enhance maintainability by minimizing ripple effects when changes are made. This is particularly important given the complex configuration management across many model variants identified as a risk.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor shared utility modules to reduce dependencies between components, implement dependency inversion principles, and establish clearer boundaries between modules to minimize direct references between unrelated components.",
  "risks": "Over-decoupling may introduce unnecessary abstraction layers that could impact performance and increase complexity. Care must be taken to balance coupling reduction with system efficiency and developer comprehension."
