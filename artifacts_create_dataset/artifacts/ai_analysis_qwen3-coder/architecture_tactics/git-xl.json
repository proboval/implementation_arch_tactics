  "justification": "The repository exhibits a script-based architecture with low structural complexity and tight coupling between CLI parsing and installation logic. Decomposability will help isolate concerns by breaking down the monolithic structure of cli.py and diff.py into smaller, more manageable modules. This aligns with the evidence of shallow directory depth and minimal package count, indicating a need for better modularization to improve long-term maintainability.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the codebase to introduce multiple packages or modules that encapsulate distinct functionalities such as command parsing, installation logic, and diff operations. This would increase the package count and reduce the average fan-out by creating clearer boundaries between components.",
  "risks": "Increased initial development effort to restructure existing code; potential for introducing bugs during refactoring if not done carefully."
