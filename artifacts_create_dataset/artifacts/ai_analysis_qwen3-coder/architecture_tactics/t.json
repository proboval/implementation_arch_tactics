  "justification": "The system is currently a script-based architecture with all logic contained in a single file (t.py), leading to high fan-out and lack of modular structure. Decomposability will address these maintainability issues by dividing the system into modules or layers, isolating problems, facilitating testing, and simplifying analysis. This aligns with the need to reduce the average fan-out and introduce architectural boundaries that are currently missing.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "The monolithic t.py file will be refactored into multiple modules or packages, each responsible for specific functionalities such as task parsing, storage management, CLI handling, and error management. This will reduce the max directory depth from 1 to a more structured hierarchy and lower the average fan-out by encapsulating related functions.",
  "risks": "Introducing modularity may increase initial complexity during the refactoring phase. If not carefully planned, module dependencies could lead to tight coupling, negating the benefits of decomposition. Additionally, improper separation of concerns may still result in poor maintainability."
