  "justification": "The project exhibits a script-based architecture with a flat structure, centralized logic in main.py, and no clear separation of concerns. Decomposability will help divide the monolithic main.py into modular components or layers, isolating functionality and improving maintainability. This aligns with the evidence of low package structure, high fan-out, and procedural organization.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor main.py into multiple modules or packages based on functionality (e.g., utilities, handlers, services). Introduce a layered structure to separate business logic from communication logic, improving cohesion and reducing coupling between components.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may be significant due to the large size and complexity of main.py. Without proper planning, there is a risk of introducing bugs during decomposition. Additionally, if not well-documented, the new modular structure may temporarily reduce understandability until team members adapt to the changes."
