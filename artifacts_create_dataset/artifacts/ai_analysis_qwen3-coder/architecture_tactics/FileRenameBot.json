  "justification": "The static analysis reveals an average fan-out of 6.2 and multiple modules with direct imports from other modules, indicating tight coupling. The architecture evidence also notes 'tight coupling through direct imports' and 'potential for circular dependencies.' Reducing coupling will isolate changes, minimize ripple effects, and improve maintainability by making modules more independent.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Introduce interfaces or abstract classes to decouple modules. Replace direct imports between modules with dependency injection or event-based communication. Restructure modules to depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, especially between plugins, helper functions, and database modules.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may be significant due to existing tight coupling. Introducing abstractions could increase complexity if not carefully designed. Potential for breaking changes during decoupling process if dependencies are not properly managed."
