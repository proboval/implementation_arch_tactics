  "justification": "The repository exhibits a script-based architecture with a single monolithic file (enhance.py) containing 19.0 avg_fan_out, tight coupling, and low maintainability (mi_avg: 21.3). Decomposability is the most suitable tactic to refactor this into modular components, improving isolation of concerns, testing capabilities, and overall system understanding. This directly addresses the high coupling and lack of separation of concerns noted in the analysis.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Splitting enhance.py into multiple cohesive modules such as data_loading, model_definitions, training_logic, and utility_functions. Each module will encapsulate specific responsibilities, reducing interdependencies and enabling independent development and testing.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may introduce bugs if not done carefully; potential for misaligned module boundaries requiring iterative adjustments. However, these risks are mitigated by maintaining traceability between original functionalities and new modular structure."
