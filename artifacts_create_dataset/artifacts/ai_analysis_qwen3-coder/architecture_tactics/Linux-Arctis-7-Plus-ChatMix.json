  "justification": "The repository exhibits a script-based architecture with duplicated class definitions and a flat structure, indicating low modularity and poor separation of concerns. Introducing decomposability will enable the system to be divided into distinct modules or layers, isolating functionality and reducing coupling. This directly addresses the maintainability issues stemming from tight coupling and lack of architectural structure.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the two Python files into a modular structure by extracting shared functionalities into reusable modules. Create separate modules for USB communication, logging, signal handling, and device-specific logic. This will reduce duplication and create clear boundaries between components.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may introduce bugs if not done carefully. Requires careful planning to ensure existing functionality remains intact. May increase the number of files and complexity in the short term, but will improve long-term maintainability."
