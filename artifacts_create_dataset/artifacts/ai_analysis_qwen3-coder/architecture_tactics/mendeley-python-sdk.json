  "justification": "The architecture analysis shows a modular monolith with good separation of concerns but identifies risks including 'Authentication logic is mixed with core domain models' and 'Some modules may have implicit dependencies not captured in metrics'. The low average fan-out (1.74) indicates loose coupling is already somewhat achieved, but can be further improved. Reducing coupling will address the risk of implicit dependencies and improve maintainability by narrowing the impact of changes, as indicated by the evidence 'Models and resources are organized by domain entities' which suggests potential for better decoupling between layers.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the authentication logic out of the core domain models and into dedicated authentication modules or services. Introduce interfaces or abstract base classes to define contracts between modules and reduce direct dependencies. Use dependency injection or factory patterns to manage component interactions. This may involve creating separate packages for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, and ensuring domain models do not directly depend on resource implementations.",
  "risks": "Refactoring to reduce coupling may require significant changes to existing code, especially disentangling authentication logic from domain models. Care must be taken to ensure that the introduction of abstractions does not overly complicate the codebase. There is also a risk of over-modularization as noted in the architecture risks with deep directory nesting."
