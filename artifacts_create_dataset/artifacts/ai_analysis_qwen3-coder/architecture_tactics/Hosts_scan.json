  },
  "justification": "The repository exhibits a script-based architecture with low modularity and tight coupling. Introducing decomposability will help divide the system into manageable modules or layers, isolating concerns such as scanning logic, multithreading handling, and progress bar utilities. This will simplify testing, enhance analyzability, and significantly improve maintainability by organizing code into coherent functional units.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor existing scripts into a modular structure with separate modules for scanning, concurrency handling, and UI/utility functions. Introduce clear interfaces between these modules to support separation of concerns and facilitate independent development and testing.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may be significant due to current tight coupling. Risk of introducing bugs during restructuring if not properly tested. Potential temporary decrease in productivity while team adapts to new structure."
