  "justification": "The repository is structured as a collection of standalone scripts with low interdependencies (avg_fan_out: 1.975) and no packages, indicating a script-based architecture. This limits reusability and scalability. Decomposability addresses this by promoting modular design and separation of concerns, which would improve maintainability by isolating functionality into distinct modules or layers. This aligns with the evidence that there's no clear separation of concerns and minimal architectural structure beyond educational organization.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the flat script structure into a modular architecture with defined packages and layers (e.g., data, logic, presentation). Each chapter or section could become a module with related functionality grouped together. Introduce clear interfaces between components and reduce direct dependencies through abstraction.",
  "risks": "Introducing modular structure may increase initial complexity and require significant refactoring effort. However, this is outweighed by the long-term benefits of improved maintainability, testability, and scalability. The risk of over-engineering can be mitigated by maintaining the educational nature of the examples while applying basic modular principles."
