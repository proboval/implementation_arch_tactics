  "justification": "The analysis shows that the modular monolith has a moderate average fan-out of ~4.9, indicating some modules are coordinating too much. The 'Reduced Coupling' tactic directly addresses this by minimizing dependencies between components, which will decrease the modification range and prevent ripple effects across subsystems. This aligns well with the existing modular structure and will improve long-term maintainability without requiring major architectural restructuring.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor existing modules to reduce direct dependencies through interface abstraction, dependency injection, and clearer separation of concerns. This may involve creating more explicit contracts between modules and reducing the number of direct imports between core components like client.py and server.py.",
  "risks": "Refactoring for reduced coupling may require significant code changes and careful testing to ensure existing functionality is preserved. There's also a risk of over-engineering if abstractions are taken too far, potentially impacting performance and code readability."
