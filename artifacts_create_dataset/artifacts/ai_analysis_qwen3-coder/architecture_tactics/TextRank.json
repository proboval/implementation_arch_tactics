  },
  "justification": "The project exhibits a script-based architecture with low module count and shallow directory structure, leading to limited separation of concerns. Decomposability will help reorganize the codebase into well-defined modules or layers, improving maintainability by isolating functionality, simplifying testing, and making the system easier to analyze.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the textrank/__init__.py file into multiple cohesive modules based on functionality (e.g., graph building, phrase extraction, summarization). Introduce a layered structure separating data handling, processing logic, and CLI interaction. This will increase the directory depth and package structure maturity from script-based to modular monolith.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring may introduce bugs if dependencies are not carefully managed. Team members may require time to adapt to new module boundaries. Risk of over-engineering if decomposition is taken too far for the current scale of the project."
