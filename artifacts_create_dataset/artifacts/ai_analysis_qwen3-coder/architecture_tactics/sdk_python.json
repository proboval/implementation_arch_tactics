  "justification": "The bunq SDK exhibits a well-structured layered architecture with clear separation of concerns across 18 packages. However, the static analysis reveals high package count (18) and deep directory nesting (max depth 5), indicating potential complexity in navigation and maintenance. Decomposability, through further modularization and clearer boundaries, would enhance maintainability by isolating problems, simplifying analysis, and facilitating testing. This aligns with the existing architecture's strengths while addressing the identified risks of over-engineering and complexity from deep nesting.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the 'model' package by breaking down the large 'generated' sub-package into smaller, domain-specific modules. Introduce clearer interfaces between layers to reduce coupling and increase cohesion. Consider consolidating some utility functions or moving them closer to their primary usage contexts to reduce the overall package count and directory depth.",
  "risks": "Over-modularization could lead to increased architecture bloat and management overhead. Careful consideration is needed to ensure that decomposition enhances rather than hinders understandability and maintainability. The refactoring process itself carries the risk of introducing bugs if dependencies are not properly managed."
