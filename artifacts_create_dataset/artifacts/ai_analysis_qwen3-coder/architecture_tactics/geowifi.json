  "justification": "The current script-based architecture exhibits low maintainability (mi_avg: 68.7), high fan-out (6.0), and lacks modular organization. Decomposability will address these issues by dividing the monolithic geowifi.py into cohesive modules or layers, isolating functionality such as data fetching, processing, and visualization. This aligns with the evidence of a procedural approach and minimal directory depth, suggesting a need for structural refactoring to improve scalability and clarity.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor geowifi.py into multiple modules such as data_sources/, core/, and ui/, each encapsulating specific functionalities like API interactions, business logic, and result presentation. Introduce clear interfaces between modules to reduce coupling and improve testability.",
  "risks": "Increased initial development effort due to refactoring. Risk of introducing bugs during decomposition if module boundaries are not well-defined. Potential for over-engineering if decomposition is taken too far without clear functional separation."
