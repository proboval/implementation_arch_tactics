  "justification": "The system exhibits a modular monolith architecture with high fan-out (8.33) and clear boundaries between client, server, and common modules. However, the shared 'common.py' module introduces potential coupling risks, as indicated in the architecture evidence. Applying Reduced Coupling will minimize dependencies between these components, particularly by reducing direct reliance on the common module, which currently acts as a central hub. This will decrease the ripple effect of changes and improve long-term maintainability.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the codebase to minimize direct dependencies between client.py, server.py, and common.py. Introduce interfaces or abstract classes where appropriate to decouple implementations. Restructure the common module to eliminate unnecessary shared components and promote component-specific logic. Consider creating separate utility modules for distinct functionalities such as cryptography, message handling, and configuration management.",
  "risks": "Refactoring may introduce temporary instability during the decoupling process. Careful testing is required to ensure that existing functionality remains intact. There is also a risk of over-engineering if abstraction layers are introduced unnecessarily, potentially increasing complexity rather than reducing it."
