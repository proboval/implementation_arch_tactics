  "justification": "The system exhibits tight coupling between the Assistant core and specific tool implementations, with the Assistant class directly managing tool loading, execution, and orchestration. This creates a god object anti-pattern and makes modifications risky. Applying reduced coupling will isolate components, particularly by decoupling the Assistant from direct tool dependencies through interfaces or an inversion of control mechanism.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Introduce a plugin-style tool registry and dependency injection mechanism. Refactor Assistant to depend on abstractions (BaseTool) rather than concrete implementations. Move tool discovery/loading into a separate module that registers tools with the Assistant at runtime.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring may introduce bugs due to the high fan-out and central coordinator pattern. The mixed concerns in Claude-Eng-v2 directory may complicate decoupling efforts without further modularization."
