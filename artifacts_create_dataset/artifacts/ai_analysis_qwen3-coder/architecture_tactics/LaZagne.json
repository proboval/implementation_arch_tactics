  "justification": "The LaZagne project exhibits a modular monolith architecture with clear separation of concerns across 50 packages, organized by functionality (browsers, chats, databases, etc.) and platform (Linux, Mac, Windows). However, the high directory depth (up to 7 levels) and some platform-specific code duplication indicate potential maintainability issues. The 'Localized Modification' tactic will enhance maintainability by increasing cohesion within modules and narrowing the scope of modifications, making the codebase easier to understand and modify without unintended side effects.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor existing modules to further encapsulate platform-specific logic within dedicated abstraction layers or adapter patterns. Consolidate duplicated code (e.g., crypto libraries, memorpy) into shared, well-defined interfaces. Introduce clearer boundaries between software modules and reduce cross-module dependencies by leveraging the existing ModuleInfo base class and soft_import_module pattern more consistently.",
  "risks": "Refactoring efforts may introduce bugs if not carefully managed, especially when consolidating shared libraries or altering module import mechanisms. The deep directory structure may also require careful reorganization to avoid breaking existing relative import paths. Additionally, ensuring all platform-specific adaptations are correctly abstracted without losing functionality requires thorough testing across all supported operating systems."
