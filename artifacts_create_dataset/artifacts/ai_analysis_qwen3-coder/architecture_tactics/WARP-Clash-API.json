  "justification": "The current modular monolith architecture shows signs of increasing coupling, particularly in the services layer where modules like 'subscription.py' and 'web_service.py' import numerous dependencies, including cross-references between services and utils. The static analysis also reveals an avg_fan_out of 3.95, which indicates a moderate level of interdependence. Applying Reduced Coupling will help isolate changes, reduce ripple effects, and improve long-term maintainability by enforcing stricter module boundaries.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor existing modules to minimize direct dependencies by introducing interfaces or abstracting shared functionalities into common utilities. For example, break direct imports between services by creating a shared contract or event-based communication where appropriate. Introduce dependency inversion principles to reduce reliance on concrete implementations.",
  "risks": "Over-abstraction may increase complexity if not carefully implemented. Additionally, refactoring tightly coupled components may introduce short-term instability if not thoroughly tested. Proper unit and integration testing will be essential to mitigate these risks."
