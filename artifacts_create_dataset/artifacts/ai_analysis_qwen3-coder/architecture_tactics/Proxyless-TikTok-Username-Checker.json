  "justification": "The repository exhibits a script-based architecture with a flat structure, no packages, and limited separation of concerns. Decomposability will help reorganize the code into modular components, improving maintainability by isolating functionality, enabling easier testing, and simplifying future changes. This directly addresses the identified risks of limited scalability and lack of clear separation of concerns.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the codebase into a modular structure with separate packages for different concerns such as username checking logic, user interface handling, and utility functions. Introduce clear interfaces between modules to support independent development and testing.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may introduce bugs if not done carefully. Requires updating import statements and ensuring all dependencies are properly managed. Team members need to adapt to the new modular structure."
