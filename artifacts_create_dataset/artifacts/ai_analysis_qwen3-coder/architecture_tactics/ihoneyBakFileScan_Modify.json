  "justification": "The system is currently structured as a single script with high fan-out and no modular organization, leading to maintainability concerns. Decomposability will address these issues by dividing the system into distinct modules or layers. This approach isolates functionality, simplifies testing, and makes the codebase easier to analyze and modify. Given the flat directory structure and lack of packages, introducing decomposition via modularization is the most impactful step toward improving maintainability.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the single-file script into multiple modules based on functional responsibilities (e.g., scanning logic, URL validation, result handling). Introduce a package structure to organize related functionalities and reduce coupling between components.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may introduce bugs if not done carefully. Requires thorough testing to ensure behavior remains consistent. Team members may need time to adapt to the new structure."
