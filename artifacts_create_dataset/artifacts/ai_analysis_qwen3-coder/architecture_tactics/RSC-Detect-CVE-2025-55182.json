  },
  "justification": "The project is currently a single-file script with low maintainability and no modular structure. Applying decomposability will allow breaking the monolithic main.py into smaller, manageable modules or layers, which directly addresses the lack of organization and poor maintainability index (45.75). This tactic supports better separation of concerns, simplifies testing, and makes future changes less risky.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Introduce a modular structure by splitting main.py into multiple files based on functionality (e.g., dependency verification, target analysis). Create directories for logical grouping (e.g., utils, core) to improve directory depth and package organization.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring may introduce bugs if not done carefully. Requires updating import statements and ensuring all functions are correctly modularized without breaking existing functionality."
