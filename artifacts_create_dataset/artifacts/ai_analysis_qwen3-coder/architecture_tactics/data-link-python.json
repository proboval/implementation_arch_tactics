  "justification": "The architecture analysis reveals tight coupling between operations and models, as well as some cross-cutting concerns like API configuration that are not fully decoupled. The layered architecture shows good separation but has risks related to coupling that impact maintainability. Reducing coupling will address the identified risks while improving the overall maintainability score and making future changes less risky.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Introduce interfaces and dependency injection to decouple operations from concrete model implementations. Extract API configuration as a separate service module that can be injected where needed. Create abstraction layers for external dependencies like HTTP connections to reduce direct coupling between models and infrastructure components.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may be significant due to existing tight coupling. Runtime overhead from additional abstraction layers. Potential breaking changes to existing API consumers if not implemented carefully with backward compatibility."
