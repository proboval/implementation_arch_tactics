  "justification": "The repository exhibits a script-based architecture with low fan-out and no package structure, indicating isolated scripts rather than modular components. Decomposability will introduce modular design principles, enabling better isolation of functionality, simplified testing, and easier analysis. This directly addresses the lack of organization and potential for code duplication.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Scripts will be grouped into logical modules or packages based on functionality (e.g., UI components, data processing, callbacks). This will involve creating directories for shared utilities, components, and services, and refactoring existing scripts to import from these modules instead of duplicating code.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring may require significant effort to restructure existing scripts. Without proper documentation or naming conventions, determining module boundaries could be subjective. Additionally, introducing modules without clear guidelines may lead to inconsistent structure if not properly managed."
