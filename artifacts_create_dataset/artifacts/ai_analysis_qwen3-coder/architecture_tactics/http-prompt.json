  "justification": "The application exhibits a modular monolith architecture with clear module separation but has an average fan-out of 3.39, indicating moderate inter-module dependencies. The 'execution.py' file shows high complexity (MI rank C) and imports numerous modules, suggesting tight coupling. Applying Reduced Coupling will decrease modification range and prevent ripple effects across subsystems, directly addressing maintainability concerns highlighted in the static analysis.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Introduce interfaces/abstract classes to decouple dependent modules, especially around the execution module. Restructure import relationships to reduce direct dependencies between components like completer, lexer, and execution. Implement dependency inversion through constructor injection or factory patterns where appropriate.",
  "risks": "Refactoring for reduced coupling may require significant interface design changes. The single entry point pattern in 'cli.py' might need restructuring to accommodate looser coupling between modules. Care must be taken to preserve existing functionality during decoupling efforts."
