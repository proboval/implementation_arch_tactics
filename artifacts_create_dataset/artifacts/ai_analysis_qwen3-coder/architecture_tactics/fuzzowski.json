  "justification": "The architecture analysis reveals that while the system has low to moderate coupling (avg_fan_out: 2.85), there are specific areas where coupling can be further reduced to improve maintainability. The 'fuzzers' module contains protocol-specific implementations that could benefit from further decoupling, as noted in the risks. Applying reduced coupling principles will help isolate changes, prevent ripple effects, and make the system more modular and easier to maintain.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Implement interface-based decoupling for protocol-specific fuzzer implementations, enhance dependency inversion through additional abstraction layers, and utilize dependency injection patterns to reduce direct dependencies between modules. This may involve creating more generic interfaces and moving protocol-specific logic behind well-defined boundaries.",
  "risks": "Over-decoupling may introduce additional complexity in terms of increased abstraction layers and potential performance overhead. Care must be taken to balance decoupling with system complexity and performance requirements."
