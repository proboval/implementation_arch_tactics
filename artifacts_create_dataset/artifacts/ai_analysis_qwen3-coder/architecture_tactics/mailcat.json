  },
  "justification": "The application is currently a single-file script with high fan-out and no package structure, leading to maintainability issues. Decomposability will address these concerns by dividing the system into modules or layers, isolating problems, facilitating testing, and simplifying analysis. This aligns directly with the need to reduce coupling and improve cohesion as indicated in the static analysis.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor mailcat.py into a modular structure with separate files for different concerns such as network handling, utility functions, execution logic, and configuration. Introduce a package structure to organize related functionalities and reduce the average fan-out by encapsulating related operations within individual modules.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may introduce bugs if not done carefully. Requires updating import statements and ensuring that inter-module dependencies are well-defined. Potential for increased directory depth which must be managed to avoid over-complication."
