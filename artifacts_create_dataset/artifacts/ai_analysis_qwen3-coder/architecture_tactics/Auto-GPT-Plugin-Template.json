  },
  "justification": "The system is currently a modular monolith with a single package and limited file analysis. Although maintainability scores are high, the architecture shows signs of being under-analyzed or simplified. Decomposability will help isolate components, improve testability, and make future modifications easier by enforcing clearer boundaries between functionalities. This aligns with the existing abstract base class pattern and supports scaling the plugin architecture effectively.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the src/auto_gpt_plugin_template module into multiple cohesive submodules based on functional responsibilities (e.g., handling user input, planning, command execution). Introduce explicit layers or modules for different concerns while preserving the plugin interface contract.",
  "risks": "Introducing more modules may increase directory depth and complexity if not carefully managed. However, given the current low package count and shallow directory structure, this risk is minimal. Proper naming conventions and documentation must be maintained to avoid confusion."
