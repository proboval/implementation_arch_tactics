  "justification": "The project exhibits a modular monolith architecture with clear separation of concerns and low average fan-out (2.12), indicating existing loose coupling. However, the presence of 20+ test models and missing maintainability metrics (mi_min is 0.0) suggest potential complexity in managing dependencies. Applying reduced coupling tactics will further isolate modules, making modifications easier and reducing ripple effects during changes.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor existing module interfaces to minimize direct dependencies between components. Introduce abstraction layers where necessary to break tight couplings, especially between the core treebeard library and the extensive test models. This may involve creating more defined APIs and using dependency injection patterns.",
  "risks": "Over-engineering abstractions could introduce unnecessary complexity. Care must be taken to balance decoupling with performance considerations, as additional abstraction layers may impact runtime efficiency. The high number of existing test models may require significant refactoring effort to properly decouple."
