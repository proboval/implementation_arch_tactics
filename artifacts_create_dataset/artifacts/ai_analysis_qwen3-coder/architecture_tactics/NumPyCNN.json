  "justification": "The architecture exhibits a modular monolith structure with low directory depth and distinct class responsibilities, yet the low maintainability index (mi_avg=60.76) suggests potential tight coupling within modules. Applying reduced coupling will minimize dependencies between components, limiting the ripple effect of changes and improving long-term maintainability. This aligns with the modular nature already present in the codebase and directly addresses the maintainability risks identified.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor existing modules to decrease inter-dependencies by introducing clearer interfaces and reducing direct references between classes. This may involve creating more defined boundaries between layers and using dependency injection or similar patterns where applicable.",
  "risks": "Refactoring for lower coupling may require significant changes to existing interactions between components, especially in the cnn.py and TutorialProject/NumPyCNN.py files which appear to have tightly coupled functions. Care must be taken to ensure that decoupling does not overcomplicate the design or introduce unnecessary abstractions."
