  },
  "justification": "The architecture exhibits some signs of tight coupling, particularly in 'rma.redis' with many helper functions and 'application.py' handling multiple responsibilities. Applying Reduced Coupling will minimize dependencies between modules, making the system easier to maintain and modify. This aligns with the existing modular structure and supports long-term evolution.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor 'rma.redis' to delegate helper functions to appropriate modules in 'rma.helpers'. Decompose 'application.py' into smaller, focused modules that handle specific concerns like orchestration, configuration, and reporting coordination. Introduce interfaces or abstract base classes where necessary to reduce direct dependencies.",
  "risks": "Refactoring core modules like 'application.py' and 'rma.redis' may introduce bugs if not carefully tested. The increased modularity could also lead to more files and potential complexity in navigation, though this is outweighed by improved maintainability."
