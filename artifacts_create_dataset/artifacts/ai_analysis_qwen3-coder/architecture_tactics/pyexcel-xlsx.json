  "justification": "The analysis reveals a tight coupling to the openpyxl library, which is listed as a risk. By applying the Reduced Coupling tactic, we can isolate the dependency on openpyxl, making the system more maintainable and easier to modify. This approach will also improve testability and reduce the ripple effects of changes, aligning with the existing modular structure and plugin-based design.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Introduce an abstraction layer or adapter pattern to decouple the core logic from the openpyxl library. This would involve creating interfaces for spreadsheet operations and implementing adapters for openpyxl. The change would allow for easier replacement or upgrade of the underlying library without affecting the rest of the system.",
  "risks": "Initial implementation effort to create the abstraction layer. Potential performance overhead due to additional indirection. Need to ensure backward compatibility during the transition."
