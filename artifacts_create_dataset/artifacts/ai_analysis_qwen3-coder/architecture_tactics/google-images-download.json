  "justification": "The system exhibits a script-based architecture with a monolithic class (googleimagesdownload) containing excessive responsibilities and tight coupling. Decomposability will address these maintainability issues by dividing the system into smaller, isolated modules or layers. This aligns with the evidence of low package count, minimal abstraction layers, and high fan-out, indicating a need for better modularization. The tactic supports separation of concerns, simplifies analysis, and facilitates testing, directly improving the maintainability factors highlighted in the static analysis (C1, C2, A3).",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the monolithic googleimagesdownload.py into multiple cohesive modules based on functionality (e.g., download logic, URL building, file handling, configuration parsing). Introduce clear interfaces between these modules and restructure the package hierarchy to reflect logical separations. Update __init__.py and __main__.py to accommodate the new modular structure.",
  "risks": "Increased initial development effort to refactor the existing monolithic structure. Potential for introducing new integration issues during decomposition. Risk of over-engineering if module boundaries are not well-defined. However, these risks are outweighed by long-term maintainability gains."
