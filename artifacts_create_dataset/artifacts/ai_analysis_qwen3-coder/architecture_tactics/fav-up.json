  },
  "justification": "The application is currently a single-file script with high fan-out and no modular structure, leading to poor maintainability. Decomposability will address these issues by dividing the system into modules or layers, isolating concerns, and simplifying testing and analysis. This directly aligns with the need to reduce coupling and increase cohesion in the codebase.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the monolithic favUp.py file into multiple modules such as favicon_processing.py, shodan_integration.py, data_handling.py, and main.py. Introduce a layered architecture separating concerns like UI/command-line parsing, business logic, and external integrations.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may introduce bugs if not done carefully. Requires thorough testing to ensure functionality remains intact. Team members may need time to adapt to the new structure if they are used to the flat layout."
