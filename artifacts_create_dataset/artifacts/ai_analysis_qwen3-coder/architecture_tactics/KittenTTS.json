  "justification": "The KittenTTS codebase exhibits a modular monolith architecture with clear separation of concerns and low directory depth, indicating an existing emphasis on cohesion. However, the average fan-out is relatively low (1.75), and some methods lack implementation details, suggesting potential for improved modularity. By applying the Localized Modification tactic, we can further increase cohesion within modules, ensuring that related functionalities are grouped together. This will reduce the scope of modifications when changes occur, making the system easier to maintain and adapt over time.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor existing modules to ensure high cohesion by grouping related functions and classes more closely. For example, text processing utilities in 'onnx_model.py' could be further encapsulated into dedicated submodules if they grow in complexity. Additionally, consider extracting any utility or helper functions from 'get_model.py' into separate, well-defined modules.",
  "risks": "Over-modularization could lead to increased complexity if not carefully managed. Ensuring that each module has a single responsibility and clear interface will mitigate this risk. Also, maintaining consistent naming conventions and documentation will be crucial to preserve understandability."
