  },
  "justification": "The current script-based architecture exhibits a flat structure with high fan-out and mixed responsibilities across files, leading to low maintainability. Decomposability addresses this by promoting modular design and separation of concerns, which will isolate functionalities into distinct modules or layers. This improves testability, simplifies analysis, and makes future modifications less error-prone.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Reorganize the codebase into a layered or modular structure by grouping related functions into dedicated modules (e.g., installation logic, tool setup, utility functions). Introduce clear interfaces between these modules to reduce coupling and improve cohesion.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may be significant due to the tight coupling and lack of clear boundaries in the existing codebase. Without proper planning, there is a risk of introducing bugs during the decomposition process."
