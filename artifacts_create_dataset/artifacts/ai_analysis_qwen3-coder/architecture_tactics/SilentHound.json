  },
  "justification": "The application is currently structured as a single script with multiple responsibilities, leading to high fan-out and low modularity. Applying decomposability will allow splitting the monolithic silenthound.py into logical modules (e.g., LDAP handling, data processing, output formatting), which directly addresses the maintainability risks identified such as tight coupling and lack of separation of concerns.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the single-file script into multiple cohesive modules, each encapsulating distinct functionality such as LDAP operations, data parsing, file I/O, and presentation logic. This will reduce the avg_fan_out and improve code organization.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may introduce bugs if not done carefully. However, this is mitigated by the fact that there are no existing packages or complex dependencies to manage."
