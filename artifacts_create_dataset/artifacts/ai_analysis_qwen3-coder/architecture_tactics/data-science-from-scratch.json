  "justification": "The repository exhibits a modular monolith architecture with multiple cohesive modules such as clustering, linear_algebra, and machine_learning. However, static analysis reveals risks of tight coupling between these modules, which could complicate future modifications and increase the likelihood of ripple effects during changes. Implementing reduced coupling will enhance the independence of modules, making the system easier to maintain and modify without unintended side effects.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor module interactions to minimize direct dependencies by introducing interfaces or abstraction layers where necessary. This may involve creating clearer API boundaries between modules and reducing direct imports or calls between unrelated components.",
  "risks": "Refactoring to reduce coupling may require significant upfront effort and could introduce temporary instability if not carefully managed. Additionally, over-abstraction might occur if not balanced with practical usage patterns."
