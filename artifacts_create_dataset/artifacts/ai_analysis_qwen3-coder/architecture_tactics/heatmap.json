  "justification": "The system exhibits a script-based architecture with high fan-out (4.76) and a flat directory structure, indicating tight coupling and limited modularity. The main heatmap.py file contains numerous classes and functions, leading to reduced maintainability as evidenced by low maintainability index scores (minimum 0.29). Decomposability will address these issues by dividing the monolithic heatmap.py into logical modules or packages, isolating concerns, and simplifying analysis and testing. This aligns with the architectural evidence showing no existing packages (packages: 0) and supports long-term scalability.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the single heatmap.py file into multiple cohesive modules or packages (e.g., geometry, projection, data_processing, visualization, io). Establish clear interfaces between components to reduce coupling. Reorganize the flat structure into a hierarchical package structure with a maximum directory depth greater than 2. Update import statements in examples and tests accordingly.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may introduce bugs if dependencies are not carefully managed. Requires updating all import paths in example scripts and test files. Potential for temporary disruption in development workflow during the transition period. Risk of over-modularization if decomposition boundaries are not well-defined."
