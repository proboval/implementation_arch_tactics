  "justification": "The repository exhibits a script-based architecture with a single main Python file containing numerous functions and no modular structure. This leads to low maintainability, poor separation of concerns, and scalability issues. Applying the Decomposability tactic will help divide the monolithic script into logical modules or layers, isolating functionality and simplifying future maintenance, testing, and analysis.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the single 'Gfriends Inputer.py' file into multiple modules based on functionality (e.g., data fetching, image processing, configuration handling). Introduce a package structure to organize these modules logically, improving cohesion and reducing coupling between unrelated functions.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may introduce bugs if not done carefully. Requires thorough testing to ensure behavior remains consistent. Team members may need time to adapt to the new structure."
