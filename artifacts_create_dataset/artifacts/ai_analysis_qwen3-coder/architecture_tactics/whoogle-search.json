  "justification": "The analysis shows tight coupling between Flask framework and core logic due to direct imports and dependencies. High fan-out (avg 4.36) indicates modules depend on many other modules, increasing maintenance difficulty. Reduced coupling will isolate components, minimize ripple effects during changes, and improve overall system modularity.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Introduce interfaces/abstract classes to decouple Flask dependencies from business logic. Create adapter patterns for framework-specific code. Restructure service layer to minimize direct framework imports. Implement dependency inversion principle to reduce direct dependencies between modules.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may introduce bugs. Requires careful interface design to maintain functionality. May need to restructure existing integration tests to accommodate new abstraction layers."
