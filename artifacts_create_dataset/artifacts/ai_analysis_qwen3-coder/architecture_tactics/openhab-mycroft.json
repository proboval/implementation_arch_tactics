  "justification": "The current architecture exhibits a script-based structure with all logic contained in a single __init__.py file, leading to low maintainability (MI=35.09), high fan-out (6.0), and tight coupling. Decomposability addresses these issues by dividing the monolithic skill into modular components based on functionality (e.g., item management, status handling, intent processing). This aligns with the evidence of 'no layered separation' and 'tight coupling between skill components'. The tactic improves maintainability by isolating concerns, simplifying testing, and enabling localized modifications without ripple effects.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the single __init__.py file into multiple modules such as item_manager.py, status_handlers.py, intent_processors.py, and utils.py. Each module will encapsulate related functions and be imported into the main skill class. This introduces a modular design that maintains the Mycroft skill interface while improving internal structure.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may introduce bugs if not thoroughly tested. However, the long-term benefits significantly outweigh this risk due to improved code organization and reduced complexity per module."
