  },
  "justification": "The system exhibits a modular monolith architecture with clear separation of concerns but shows moderate complexity in some modules like binance_api_manager.py. Localized Modification will enhance cohesion within modules, reducing the scope of changes and making the system easier to maintain. This aligns well with the existing modular structure and addresses the maintainability index average of 68.8 by focusing modifications to specific areas rather than spreading them across the codebase.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor existing modules to increase functional cohesion by grouping related functionalities together. This may involve splitting large classes or functions into smaller, more focused units within the same module boundaries. The overall modular monolith structure will be preserved while improving internal module organization.",
  "risks": "Refactoring for higher cohesion may require significant code changes and thorough testing to ensure no functionality is broken. There's also a risk of over-modularizing which could lead to increased directory depth beyond the current max of 3, potentially adding to organizational complexity if not managed properly."
