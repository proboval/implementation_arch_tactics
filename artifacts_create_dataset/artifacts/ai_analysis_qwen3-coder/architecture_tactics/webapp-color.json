  },
  "justification": "The application is currently structured as a single-file script with no modular organization, leading to low maintainability and scalability. Decomposability addresses this by promoting modular design and separation of concerns, which will improve code organization, testing, and long-term maintainability.",
  "expected_architectural_change": "Refactor the monolithic app.py into multiple modules such as routes, services, and configuration. Introduce a layered structure separating business logic from presentation and data access layers.",
  "risks": "Initial refactoring effort may introduce bugs if not done carefully. Requires careful planning to ensure all dependencies are correctly managed during the transition."
