### Motivation & Gap
Multiple software quality models exist (McCall, Boehm, Dromey, FURPS, ISO 9126) but selecting which one to use is a real challenge due to overlapping and inconsistent terminology across models.

### Contribution
Provides a detailed analytical comparison of five major software quality models, identifying that only "reliability" is common to all five, and concludes that ISO 9126 is the most useful model due to its international consensus basis. The paper maps maintainability sub-characteristics (analyzability, changeability, stability, testability) as defined in ISO 9126.

**Relevance:** LOW

### Models & Tools
- **LLM/AI models:** N/A
- **Tools:** N/A
- **Dataset:** N/A -- analytical comparison of 5 quality model specifications

### Challenges
The comparison is purely qualitative at the characteristic level; no empirical validation or practical application of the models is presented. Earlier models (McCall, Boehm) have metrics that are "neither clearly nor completely defined."

### Key Quotes
> "From our point of view, the ISO 9126-1 quality model is the most useful one since it has been built based on an international consensus and agreement from all the country members of the ISO organization." (p. 173)

### Key Takeaway
The evolution from McCall (1977) through ISO 9126 (2001) to ISO 25010 shows progressive refinement of maintainability decomposition -- the thesis can cite this lineage when justifying the choice of ISO 25010 sub-characteristics (modularity, reusability, analysability, modifiability, testability) as evaluation criteria.
